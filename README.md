django-project-template
---

# Usage
* Clone this repo, checkout to desired version and copy all files and directories except .git folder to new project folder
* Possible to use also with git archive and django-admin startproject


# TODO
* (to consider) use cookiecutter to setup project
  - in project there is only two places with project name that needs to be adjusted and you are ready to go
* (to consider) instead of using cookiecutter we will develop mkproject tool to create full projects on gitlab/sentry/etc.
